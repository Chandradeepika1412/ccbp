        <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall1. The Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history1. It attracts 7-8 million visitors a year1 and was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative in 200712.</p>
