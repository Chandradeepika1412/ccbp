        <p>The Statue of Unity is a colossal statue of Indian statesman and independence activist Vallabhbhai Patel12. It is the world’s tallest statue, with a height of 182 meters (597 feet)1. The statue is located near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India1. It depicts Vallabhbhai Patel, who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi1. Patel is highly respected for his leadership in uniting 562 princely states of India to form the single Union of India1. The statue is located in Gujarat on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres southeast of the city of Vadodara1. The project was first announced in 2010, and construction started in October 2013 by Indian company Larsen & Toubro, with a total construction cost of ₹ 27 billion. It was designed by Indian sculptor Ram V. Sutar and was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel’s birth1.</p>
